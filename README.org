** Scripts
- =docs-generate=
- =dependencies-upgrade=

Both are typically run with no arguments. =docs-generate= will generate
Markdown files from Emacs Org-mode files. =dependencies-upgrade= as its name
implies, updates the dependencies.

=docs-generate= is configured to execute source blocks. The result will be
written to the Org-mode files in-place, as well as included in the exported
Markdown.
